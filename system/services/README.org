* Issues
The =tlp.service= service seems to mess with radios causing rfkill to block on startup. Recommendations via the documentation is to mask the rfkill systemd service
#+begin_src sh
systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service
systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.socket
#+end_src

Need implementation in =configuration.nix= to do this automatically on boot.
** First Attempt at Resolution

  This does indeed mask rfkill, however, rfkill is still blocking on boot. Disabling TLP untill resolution is found
  #+begin_src nix
    systemd = {
      sockets.systemd-rfkill.enable = false;
      services.systemd-rfkill.enable = false;
    };
  #+end_src
